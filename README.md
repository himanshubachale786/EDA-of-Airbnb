Conclusion:

We can conclude from the analysis that Manhattan is the top neighbourhood group when it comes to the number of listings and highest rental prices. Given that Manhattan is a world-famous for its museums, stores, parks and theatres - and its substantial number of tourists throughout the year, hence the prices are much higher in this.

The 2 neighbourhood group in Brooklyn having significant number of listings and more affordable prices as compared to Manhattan. For other neighbourhood groups namely Queens, Bronx and Staten island there aren't as many listing options available, especially on Staten Island. Considering that those are residential areas, it is possible that many guests choose these locations to save up money or perhaps to visit family and friends who live in this area.

For our data exploration purpose, it would have been nice to have couple of additional features like positive and negative reviews. Depending upon that we could have gauged the popularity of each neighbourhood.
